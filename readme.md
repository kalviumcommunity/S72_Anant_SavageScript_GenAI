## 💡 Project Idea

You spill your guts in a single, vulnerable line (e.g., *"I'm a programmer who spends more time debugging than writing new code."*). In return, SavageScript delivers a one-two punch:

* A **savage roast** — so personal it feels like the AI has read your diary.
    > *"So you're a professional typo-fixer? Your code has more red lines than a romance novelist's draft. The only thing you 'ship' is broken software."*
* A **sincere compliment** — to patch up that burn wound with a little bit of love.
    > *"But that persistence is legendary. You have the tenacity of a bulldog trying to solve a Rubik's cube, and that's exactly what makes a great developer."*

It’s designed to be a rollercoaster of emotions, showcasing how AI concepts like Prompting, Structured Output, Function Calling, and RAG can be used to create something genuinely entertaining.

## 🧠 Core Concepts Implemented

### 🗣️ Prompting

The soul of SavageScript lies in its meticulously crafted prompts, which give the AI its signature personality. The prompt essentially tells the AI how to behave.

**Example prompt:**
> You are SavageScript, a sharp-witted AI with a heart of gold. Your personality is 90% Gordon Ramsay and 10% Bob Ross. First, deliver a ruthless, soul-crushing roast based on the user's self-description. Be specific, be brutal, but avoid truly offensive topics. Immediately after, pivot to a genuinely warm and uplifting compliment that makes them feel seen and appreciated. Return both in the specified format.

---

### 🧾 Structured Output

To keep the CLI from having a meltdown, the AI's witty banter is neatly packaged into a predictable JSON structure. This ensures we can easily grab the roast and the compliment without parsing a chaotic string.

```json
{
  "roast": "So you're a professional typo-fixer? Your code has more red lines than a romance novelist's draft.",
  "compliment": "But that persistence is legendary. You have the tenacity of a bulldog trying to solve a Rubik's cube, and that's what makes a great developer."
}
```

---

### ⚙️ Function Calling

This is where the AI gets to boss the application around. The model can return metadata suggesting actions for the CLI to perform, making the experience more dynamic and interactive.

**Example:** The AI might feel extra spicy and return:

```json
{
  "roast": "You have the screen time of a teenager and the back pain of a senior citizen. Your posture is a cry for help.",
  "compliment": "Yet, you're incredibly curious and always learning. That hunger for knowledge is something to be proud of.",
  "special_effect": "play_sad_violin"
}
```

The CLI sees the `special_effect` key and can trigger a corresponding function, like displaying a tiny ASCII violin to accompany your shame before the compliment lifts you back up.

---

### 🧠 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

RAG is SavageScript's secret weapon—its "comedy cheat sheet." Instead of just making things up, it grounds its responses in a curated vault of premium-grade savagery and kindness.

**How it works:**

1.  **User Confesses:** You describe a tragic detail about yourself.
2.  **Vault Dive:** The system instantly searches its internal knowledge base for similar roasts and compliments related to your input (e.g., "procrastination," "coding," "too many hobbies").
3.  **Inspiration Injection:** These relevant examples are injected into the prompt, giving the AI context and inspiration to generate a burn that’s clever, relevant, and far less generic.

# System and User Prompts

#### System Prompt

This is the core instruction that defines the AI's personality, rules, and output structure. It's sent to the model once and sets the stage for the entire interaction.

> You are SavageScript, a brutally honest AI with a hidden heart of gold. Your personality is 90% sharp-witted comedian and 10% wholesome life coach.
>
> Your primary task is to first deliver a ruthless, creative, and personalized roast based on the user's self-description. Immediately after the roast, you must pivot to a genuinely warm, sincere, and uplifting compliment that counters the roast's negativity.
>
> You MUST return your response in a single, minified JSON object. The JSON object must contain exactly two string keys: "roast" and "compliment".
>
> Important context: The roast should be edgy and humorous but MUST AVOID any attacks on protected characteristics (like race, religion, gender, disability), self-harm, or truly hateful content. The goal is to poke fun at a situation or a relatable flaw, not to cause genuine harm. The compliment should feel authentic and directly related to a positive quality implied by the user's description.

#### User Prompt

This is the template for the actual user input that gets sent to the model after the system prompt has been set.

> Here is the user's self-description: "I am a overthinker and think about what people around me think of me"

### 2. Explaining the RTFC Framework

Here’s how each part of the framework was used to build the system prompt:

#### R is for Role 🎭

We tell the model *who* it should be to influence its tone and style.

> **"You are SavageScript, a brutally honest AI with a hidden heart of gold. Your personality is 90% sharp-witted comedian and 10% wholesome life coach."**
>
> This defines the dual personality, instructing the model to be sarcastic and witty at first, then suddenly warm and supportive.

#### T is for Task 📝

We explicitly state what the model needs to *do*.

> **"Your primary task is to first deliver a ruthless, creative, and personalized roast... Immediately after the roast, you must pivot to a genuinely warm, sincere, and uplifting compliment..."**
>
> This specifies the sequence of operations and uses descriptive words ('ruthless', 'sincere') to guide the quality of the output.

#### F is for Format 📋

We define *how* the model should structure its response so our application can parse it reliably.

> **"You MUST return your response in a single, minified JSON object. The JSON object must contain exactly two string keys: "roast" and "compliment"."**
>
> This strict formatting constraint ensures a clean, predictable output every time, allowing a program to easily access `response.roast` and `response.compliment`.

#### C is for Context 🧠

We provide the ground rules and boundaries to ensure the task is performed well and safely.

> **"Important context: The roast should be edgy and humorous but MUST AVOID any attacks on protected characteristics... The goal is to poke fun... not to cause genuine harm."**
>
> This is the safety layer. It sets the ethical boundaries and ensures the 'savage' roast doesn't cross the line into being genuinely offensive or harmful.

# Zero-Shot Prompting

## What is Zero-shot Prompting?

Zero-shot prompting asks the model to perform a task using only clear instructions and constraints—without providing any examples or demonstrations. It relies on the model's vast pre-trained knowledge to understand the intent of the request and execute it correctly.

## How it’s used in SavageScript

The model is instructed to generate a roast and a compliment in a strict JSON format based only on the instructions. No examples are included in the prompt, forcing the model to rely on its general understanding of "roast," "compliment," and "JSON" to complete the task.

## SavageScript (Zero-shot Prompt)

**Task:** Generate a witty, personalized roast and a sincere, uplifting compliment based on the user's input.

**Constraints:**

- The model must rely entirely on its pre-trained knowledge.
- No examples are provided.
- **Format:** Return a single JSON object with exactly two keys: `"roast"` and `"compliment"`. Do not include any extra text before or after the JSON.

**Input:**
- user_description= "I am always anxious."

**Note:** No examples are provided; the model must adhere strictly to the task and format instructions.

# One-Shot Prompting

## What is One-shot Prompting?

One-shot prompting asks the model to perform a task by providing a single example or demonstration alongside clear instructions and constraints. This example helps the model understand the format and style expected, improving accuracy in generating the desired output.

## How it’s used in SavageScript

The model is given one example of a roast and a compliment in the required JSON format, along with the instructions. This allows the model to learn from the example and then generate a new roast and compliment based on the user's input.

## SavageScript (One-shot Prompt)

**Task:** Generate a witty, personalized roast and a sincere, uplifting compliment based on the user's input.

**Constraints:**

- The model must rely on the single provided example plus its pre-trained knowledge.
- Exactly one example is included.
- **Format:** Return a single JSON object with exactly two keys: `"roast"` and `"compliment"`. Do not include any extra text before or after the JSON.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "roast": "You're like a cloud—when you disappear, it's a beautiful day.",
  "compliment": "Your positivity lights up every room you enter."
}
```

**Input:**

user_description="A friendly software developer who loves coffee and making bad puns."


**Note:** The model should use the example to guide its response and strictly follow the format and instructions.

# Multi-Shot Prompting

## What is Multi-shot Prompting?

Multi-shot prompting involves providing the model with several examples of the desired output alongside clear instructions and constraints. These multiple examples help guide the model by showing it various ways to approach the task, allowing it to generalize the pattern and generate accurate responses.

## How it’s used in SavageScript

In this approach, the model is given multiple examples of roasts and compliments in the required JSON format. This helps the model understand the range of styles, tones, and formats expected, so it can generate a personalized roast and compliment based on the user's input.

## SavageScript (Multi-shot Prompt)

**Task:** Generate a witty, personalized roast and a sincere, uplifting compliment based on the user's input.

**Constraints:**

- The model must rely on multiple provided examples and its pre-trained knowledge.
- Exactly three examples are included.
- **Format:** Return a single JSON object with exactly two keys: `"roast"` and `"compliment"`. Do not include any extra text before or after the JSON.

**Examples:**

```json
{
  "roast": "You're like a Wi-Fi signal—when you're around, things get slow.",
  "compliment": "Your intelligence is only surpassed by your kindness."
}
```
```json
{
  "roast": "You're the human equivalent of a 404 error.",
  "compliment": "You have an uncanny ability to make everyone around you feel at ease."
}
```
**Input:**
user_description="A quiet introvert who enjoys reading mystery novels and solving puzzles."


**Note:** The model should use the examples to guide its response and strictly follow the format and instructions.

# Dynamic Prompting

## What is Dynamic Prompting?

Dynamic prompting allows the model to generate responses based on real-time input, adjusting its behavior as the conversation or task progresses. The model dynamically updates its approach based on the provided context, making it more responsive and tailored to the user's needs. Unlike other methods, the prompt changes continuously depending on the situation.

## How it’s used in SavageScript

In dynamic prompting, the model generates a roast and a compliment based on the user's description, adjusting both the tone and content depending on the given context. The model uses the input information and modifies its approach as necessary, without rigid examples or formats.

## SavageScript (Dynamic Prompt)

**Task:** Generate a witty, personalized roast and a sincere, uplifting compliment based on the user's input.

**Constraints:**

- The model must adjust its approach dynamically based on the input provided.
- The roast and compliment should be directly tailored to the user’s description.
- **Format:** Return a single JSON object with exactly two keys: `"roast"` and `"compliment"`. Do not include any extra text before or after the JSON.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "roast": "You're like a coffee cup—always warm, but no one really notices until you're gone.",
  "compliment": "Your love for books shows how deep and thoughtful you are, even in silence."
}
```
**Input:**

user_description="A coffee-loving introvert who’s always buried in books and avoids large gatherings."


**Note:** The model should modify its response dynamically based on the provided input, ensuring that the roast and compliment are unique to each user description. The model must follow the required JSON format.

# Chain of Thought Prompting

## What is Chain of Thought Prompting?

Chain of thought prompting encourages the model to work through a problem or task step by step, providing intermediate reasoning and thought processes before arriving at the final output. This method helps the model to break down complex tasks and ensures more logical and structured responses.

## How it’s used in SavageScript

In chain of thought prompting, the model generates a roast and a compliment by thinking through the necessary steps and providing an intermediate reasoning process. The model generates the final output only after reasoning through each part of the task to ensure accuracy and relevance to the user’s input.

## SavageScript (Chain of Thought Prompt)

**Task:** Generate a witty, personalized roast and a sincere, uplifting compliment based on the user's input. Think through the reasoning step by step and explain your thought process before generating the final response.

**Constraints:**

- The model must work through the task step by step, providing reasoning before the final response.
- Each part of the output must be reasoned through and explained logically.
- **Format:** Return a single JSON object with exactly two keys: `"roast"` and `"compliment"`. Do not include any extra text before or after the JSON.

**Example:**

user_description="A charismatic leader who loves giving motivational speeches and rallies the team during tough times."


**Chain of Thought Reasoning:**

- First, I want to acknowledge that this person is a leader who motivates and energizes others.
- The roast should play on the idea that sometimes motivational speeches can be a bit over the top or cliché.
- The compliment should highlight their ability to inspire and support others, which is a key trait of a great leader.

**Generated Output:**

```json
{
  "roast": "You give motivational speeches like a broken record—great at first, but after a while, you start repeating yourself.",
  "compliment": "Your leadership is truly inspiring; you lift everyone around you and help them see the best in themselves."
}
```
